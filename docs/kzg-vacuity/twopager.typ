[
= I · The finding: axiom-clean, and empty

== The mechanism
KZG evaluation binding is proved in ArkLib by a correct, constructive reduction to the `t`-SDH assumption — whose adversary is a *plain, unrestricted function type*:

```lean
abbrev tSdhAdversary (D : ℕ) :=
  Vector G₁ (D+1) × Vector G₂ 2 → StateT unifSpec.QueryCache ProbComp (Option (ZMod p × G₁))

def tSdhAssumption (D : ℕ) (error : ℝ≥0) : Prop :=
  ∀ (adversary : tSdhAdversary D), tSdhExperiment D adversary ≤ error
```

`ProbComp` is a free monad over oracle queries: only `query` nodes cost anything; pure computation is free and no resource bound is imposed anywhere. The SRS includes the verifier leg $(g_2, g_2^tau)$, which determines $tau$ whenever $g_2 eq.not 1$, and ArkLib's own `exists_zmod_power_of_generator` (`Algebra.lean:105`) makes the discrete log `Classical.choice`-definable. The adversary reads $g_2^tau$, recovers $tau$, and returns the `t`-SDH solution #box($(c = 0, g_1^(1\/tau))$) — zero oracle queries, success probability exactly 1.

```lean
noncomputable def tauExtractingAdversary (hg₂ : g₂ ≠ 1) (D : ℕ) : tSdhAdversary D :=
  fun srs => pure (some (0, g₁ ^ (1 / dlogOf hg₂ srs.2[1]).val))

theorem tSdhExperiment_tauExtractingAdversary : tSdhExperiment D (…) = 1
theorem not_tSdhAssumption      (herr : error < 1) : ¬ tSdhAssumption D error
theorem tSdhAssumption_trivial_of_one_le (1 ≤ error) : tSdhAssumption D error
```

== No content at any parameter
Below 1 the assumption is refuted; at $gt.eq 1$ its conclusion is the triviality "a probability is $lt.eq 1$." `binding` consumes the assumption in the last step of its `calc`, and its hypothesis `hpair : pairing g₁ g₂ ≠ 0` *forces* $g_2 eq.not 1$ (a bilinear map kills the identity) — exactly what the extractor needs. So `binding`'s hypotheses are jointly unsatisfiable for any error below 1 (`binding_hypotheses_unsatisfiable`), and its conclusion is free at $gt.eq 1$. The sibling ARSDH assumption falls identically, taking `function_binding` with it. A canary — the giving-up adversary scores exactly 0 — confirms the experiment discriminates. The reduction itself is fully constructive and algebraically correct; the vacuity lives entirely in the assumption's quantifier.

== The pattern, not a typo
Reducing to a *different* base assumption does not escape. The natural `q`-DLOG assumption, stated in ArkLib's own unrestricted-adversary idiom, is equally false below 1 (`not_qDlogAssumption`, same extraction, own canary). And ArkLib's algebraic-group-model scaffolding confirms the disease from the other side: `AGM/Basic.lean` is a stub (its adversary's `run` is literally `sorry`; zero theorems; orphaned) and is *unsound as written* — the adversary is a `ReaderT` over the concrete group table, so its outputs can still depend on discrete logs. Its author flags the open problem verbatim: #quote[TODO: need to be sure this definition is correct]; #quote[How to make the adversary truly independent of the group description? It could have had `G` hardwired.] Any concrete-group assumption of the shape $forall "unrestricted adversary", "Pr"["win"] lt.eq epsilon < 1$ is `Classical.choice`-false in this idiom.

== The methodological point: axiom checks are blind to vacuity
`binding`, the refutation, and the winning adversary all print the *same* clean axiom closure:

```lean
#print axioms not_tSdhAssumption   -- [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

No `sorryAx`, nothing any `#print axioms` / `#assert_axioms` gate would flag. *Axiom-clean and vacuous coexist.* The blindness is structural: an axiom check reports a proof term's closure; it never asks whether the theorem's *hypotheses* are jointly satisfiable, and any `def FooHard : Prop` used as a hypothesis is an assumption no axiom check inspects. Query-based bounds (`IsQueryBoundP`) do not help either — the winning adversary makes zero queries. The only reliable test is adversarial: try to *inhabit the assumption's negation* — prove the floor false at its deployed parameters. We found the identical pattern in our own hardness floors first, in several places, before ever looking at ArkLib; we present this as a field lesson, not a dunk.

[
= II · The repair, the number, and the end-to-end theorem

== The mergeable de-vacuation (mechanized)
ArkLib's reduction is already constructive, and the assumption is consumed at exactly one `calc` step — so split there. The unconditional prefix becomes the primary theorem; the original `binding` becomes a one-line corollary.

```lean
theorem binding_reduces_to_tSdh … (adversary : KzgBindingAdversary …) :
    bindingExperiment … adversary
      ≤ tSdhExperiment g₁ g₂ n (bindingReduction … adversary)
```

No assumption `Prop`: both sides are concrete probabilities, true at every parameter — nothing for `Classical.choice` to inhabit. The diff is +41/−14 in one file; the whole tree builds (2994 jobs); axiom-clean. And it *provably survives the exact attack* (`repair_survives_attack`): in one `sorry`-free closure, (1) the trapdoor adversary still refutes `tSdhAssumption` below 1, and (2) the repaired bound holds regardless. The cure removes the unsatisfiable premise while keeping every step of the reduction. It does not by itself supply a number — it isolates the one obligation a sound assumption class must discharge.

== The number: the generic bilinear group bound
Group elements become opaque handles carrying *ordinary* polynomials in $ZZ_p [X]$ — *not Laurent*: group inversion negates the exponent, it never introduces $X^(-1)$. A winning $1\/(X+c)$ is therefore unrepresentable, and a "win" forces the nonzero, degree-$lt.eq D+1$ polynomial $F_ell dot (X+c) - 1$ to vanish at the random $tau$. Simulation (identical-until-bad) plus Schwartz–Zippel yield Boneh–Boyen's Theorem 12, verified line by line against the source:
$ epsilon space lt.eq space (q_G + D + 3)^2 (D+1) / (p-1) space = space O((q_G + D)^2 dot D \/ p) $
*Not* a clean $q^2\/p$: the bound is cubic in the SRS degree $D$, and at production parameters the $D^3\/p$ term is the one to watch (Corollary 13's $q < O(p^(1\/3))$ side condition). Naive AGM is not a shortcut: an adversary that *also* returns a valid representation is still `Classical.choice`-inhabitable — validity is not independence — so the AGM route relocates the same content onto `q`-DLog's generic hardness.

== The end-to-end theorem #text(size: 8.4pt, fill: inkdim, font: sans)[(mechanized, `sorry`-free, no `sorryAx`)]
The generic-group bound is now a *complete* mechanized theorem about ArkLib's *own* `Groups.tSdhExperiment`, restated nowhere. For every generic strategy `strat` and query budget `fuel`:

```lean
tSdh_ggm_sound : tSdhExperiment D (embed strat) ≤ (C(fuel+D+4, 2)·D + (D+1)) / (p − 1)
```

the Shoup random-encoding number at $delta = D$, a genuine $< 1$ in the standard regime (`tSdh_ggm_sound_lt_one`). *Why it escapes the vacuity:* it does *not* quantify over the full `tSdhAdversary` type — over which the statement is provably *false* (Panel I) — but over the *image of the generic embedding* `embed`: a strategy receives only equality booleans, never a group element, so it realizes only $g_1^(f(tau))$ with $deg f lt.eq D$ — exactly what the counting bound bounds. `#print axioms` on the capstone and its full spine: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. *Honest side-conditions, named* — "sound" means sound under these: $1 lt.eq D$ (genuinely *false* at $D = 0$: with no pairing, a $G_1$ adversary cannot form $g_1^tau$); $2 lt.eq p$; $"orderOf" g_1 = p$ (with $g_1, g_2 eq.not 1$); ArkLib's own `SampleableType` instance; the $< 1$ regime $binom("fuel"+D+4, 2) dot D + (D+1) < p-1$.

== The mechanized spine #text(size: 8.4pt, fill: inkdim, font: sans)[(all `sorry`-free, axioms `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`)]
- *Vacuity refutations* — `t`-SDH, ARSDH, `q`-DLOG, each with a discriminating canary; imports genuine ArkLib at `d72f8392`, redefines nothing. *The repair and its survival* — `binding_reduces_to_tSdh`, `repair_survives_attack`.
- *Static GGM core* — `ggm_tSdh_sound`: $epsilon lt.eq (D+1)\/(p-1)$ over the *entire* committed-generic adversary type (the trapdoor extractor is untypable here); tight. As far as our census found, the first generic-group security theorem in Lean.
- *Both adaptive models* — Maurer explicit-equality (`adaptive_ggm_sound`; identical-until-bad *proven by induction*, not assumed) and Shoup random-encoding (`rand_encoding_bound`; all-pairs bad event and table size are theorems). The $delta = D$ specialization feeds the capstone.
- *Degree discharge on the ACTUAL oracle* — ArkLib's `tSdhAdversary` is granted *no pairing map*, so the oracle is purely linear; `hdeg_out_of_run` / `hdeg_handles_of_run` prove $"natDegree" lt.eq D$ by induction on the *real* `runAux`/`runTable` recursion — the degree hypotheses are theorems, the $delta = D$ bound hypothesis-free.
- *The wiring* — `embed` / `embed_run_correspondence` (the group run steps in lockstep with the symbolic run); `experiment_eq_count` (ArkLib's game collapses to $("winSet.card")\/(p-1)$); `groupWinSet_eq_realWinSet` (the win predicate *is* ArkLib's real `tSdhCondition`, by prime-order injectivity). No monad plumbing or predicate mismatch left.

== Off the critical path #text(size: 8.4pt, fill: inkdim, font: sans)[(optional — gates nothing)]
The conservative pairing-aware $delta = 2D$ variant (`degree_invariant_paired` + `rand_encoding_bound` at $Delta = 2D$) is for a *pairing-endowed* oracle the ArkLib adversary does not have — a weaker bound for a stronger, off-interface adversary, kept as the honest ceiling (the naive flat-table $2D$ claim is *refuted*: $X^4$ at $D=1$). And re-typing `bindingReduction`'s adversary as a `Strat`, so §8.1's reduction inherits the number directly — a convenience, not a gap: the result holds for the whole `embed` image already.
